# GET-It-DONE

Hi! - welcome to _Marvel Catalog Viewer_!

This App uses the Marvel Api to display their entire collections of Characters, Comics, Creators, Events, and Series in an organized and easy to use fashion.  I have also included a character match game.

### Tools used

_Marvel Catalog Viewer_ is built with react.  I used hooks for most of the functionality and styled components for the css.  React-Card-Flip package was used to make the animation in the Match Game.  Axios with Async Await is used for calling the Api to populate the pages.

### How to get started

**First clone the repo**
